**CURSE OF STRAHD**
**---------------------------------------------------**
Death House is the name given to an old row house in
the village of Barovia. The
house has been burned to the ground many times, only
to rise from the ashes time and again—by its own will or
that of Strahd. Locals give the building a wide berth for
fear of antagonizing the evil spirits believed to haunt it.
The wealthy family that built the house practiced the
dark arts. Through seduction and indoctrination, they
expanded their cult to include a small yet nefarious circle of friends. When word got out, the rest of the village
turned a blind eye to the house and the nightly debaucheries happening within it.
The cult tried to summon malevolent extraplanar entities with no success. The cultists also preyed on visitors,
sacrificed them in bizarre rituals, and hosted morbid
banquets to feast on their corpses. When nothing came
of these ritualized murders, the cultists’ activities became thinly disguised excuses to indulge their lurid fantasies. The ranks of the cult thinned as members began
to lose interest in the debacle.
Then Strahd von Zarovich arrived.
The cultists regarded Strahd as a messiah sent to
them by the Dark Powers. Drawn to Strahd like moths
to a flame, they pledged their devotion for a promise of
immortality, but Strahd turned them away, deeming the
cult and its leaders unworthy of his attention. The cultists withdrew to Death House in despair.
The cult’s habit of trapping and devouring wayward
visitors proved to be its downfall. On one occasion, the
cult snared a band of adventurers whom Strahd had
lured to his domain to be his playthings. A black carriage arrived at Death House soon thereafter, and from
out of its black heart stepped the vampire himself. The
cultists tried to impress Strahd. In response, he slaughtered them for slaying his playthings. Centuries later,
the cultists’ spirits haunt the dungeons under the house.
The building itself, it seems, is unwilling to let the cult
be forgotten.
